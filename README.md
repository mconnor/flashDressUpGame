Note- make sure you are getting past the intro. Click on the small pin-up girl.

This game was developed from scratch in two weeks. I worked with another Flash person who new virtually no action-scripting.  He made the movie clips.  I did all coding.

The code is all in two external .AS files that get compiled into the SWF.  The only code in the .FLAs is a stop(); at the end of movie clips and in a few places on the main time line. 

Coding this way greatly simplifies debugging and future modifications.  

The goal with this game is to add a new pinup girl each month.  We were instructed to make it work for just the first month.

The code does the following
1.	Starts with an preloader
2.	Starts an external mp3 file. 
3.	Keeps track of the users selections while they customize the pinup.  
4.	Interface navigation
5.	Downloads a jpeg containing all the user selections (outfit, hair, background color, pinup).  Note – this function is disabled on here.
<!-- 
Note - As you don’t have the fonts here, if you open the FLAs things might look strange.   As I said, all code is in the .AS files. -->
